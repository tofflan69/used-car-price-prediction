# Car Price Modelling & Transmission Prediction

Visual representation of a subset of the model: https://used-car-price-prediction-vilgotteiffel.streamlit.app/

This project explores a used car dataset and builds a series of models to:

1. Predict car prices using:
   - Simple (univariate) linear regression
   - Multivariate linear regression
2. Predict whether a car has **automatic** or **manual** transmission using logistic regression.

All work is done in a single Jupyter notebook.

## Files

- `used-car-price-prediction.ipynb` 
  Main notebook with all code and explanations.
- `blocket_cars.csv`  
  CSV file with car listings (prices, specifications, etc.).

Make sure the CSV file is in the **same directory** as the notebook.
