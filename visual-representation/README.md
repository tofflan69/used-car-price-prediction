# Used Car Price Prediction – Visual App

Visual representation of a subset of the model: https://used-car-price-prediction-vilgotteiffel.streamlit.app/

This repository contains a **visual, interactive representation** of my main project:
`used-car-price-prediction`.

The core modelling, data cleaning and analysis live in the
`used-car-price-prediction` repository.  
This repo focuses on turning that work into a **web app** so that anyone can
play with a subset of the models in a browser.

## What this app does

- Loads the same cleaned Blocket car data used in the main project  
- Uses the same closed-form linear regression pipeline
- Trains **separate multivariate models for the top car manufacturers**
- Lets the user:
  - Select manufacturer (from the most common brands)
  - Adjust model year, mileage and horsepower
  - See the predicted price instantly
- Shows basic data exploration and model performance metrics

In short:  
> This repo = the **interactive front-end** for the modelling work in `used-car-price-prediction`.
